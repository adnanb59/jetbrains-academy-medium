Jetbrains Java projects I'm using to sharpen up my sword (I got no current Java projects).

Apparently, these are all of medium difficulty (for people who know the basics but need to refresh).

These include:

- **Numeral System Converter:** Convert numbers to different numeral systems (bases)
- **Readability Score:** Tool to determine a text's readability level using various metrics
- **Encryption-Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher
- **Game Of Life**: Visualize Conway's Game of Life using Java's Swing library
- **Tic-Tac-Toe w/ AI**: Building on previous Tic-Tac-Toe, employ AI of various difficulties to play
- **Numeric Matrix Processor**: Complete different operations using matrices
- **Error Correcting Encoder-Decoder**: Simulate the transfer of data, as well as simulating data corruption and correction using the (7,4) Hamming Code
