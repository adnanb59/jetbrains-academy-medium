Jetbrains Java projects I'm using to sharpen up my sword (I got no current Java projects).

Apparently, these are all of medium difficulty (for people who know the basics but need to refresh).

These include:

- **Numeral System Converter:** Convert numbers to different numeral systems (bases?)
- **Smart Calculator:** Taking integer expressions and evaluating them
- **Linear Equations Solver:** Library to solve linear equations w/ multiple variables and complex numbers
