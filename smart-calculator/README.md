## smart-calculator

This program simulates a calculator that allows a user to complete integer based
math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & exponentiation).
This interactive console also allows users to store values using variables that they
can use later in evaluating expressions. The range of numbers allowed is the range allowed
by Java's BigInteger class (-2<sup>Integer.MAX_VALUE</sup> to 2<sup>Integer.MAX_VALUE</sup>-1).


In terms of expressions, on top of operations, users are able to use brackets to separate expressions.
Invalid expressions will not be allowed , and users will be met with the `Invalid Expression` response.
Variables can only use letters (so variables such as `a2` will not be allowed).

If the user wants to exit the program, they need to enter the `\exit` command.
Additionally, there is the `\help` command, which will provide information about the program.

#### Running Program
After compiling the files, you can run the program with `java Runner`.

The rest of the interaction will be done directly with the program.
