## numeral-system-converter

This program provides an interface that will allow users to convert from one base (or radix) to another.
This includes decimal numbers (so rational and irrational numbers can be converted).
Users can convert these values bases ranging to and from 1 to 36.
Any decimal values will be rounded to 5 decimal places.
Additionally, values will be checked to make sure they belong to the source base before conversion
occurs, if incorrect value (such as a for base 10) is provided then an error message will be displayed.

#### How it works
1. User will be provided with prompt: `Enter source number's base: `, where they provide a valid base (radix).
2. If source base is valid, then they can provide a number with the prompt: `Enter source number: `.
3. If source number is valid, then the prompt `Enter target number's base` will follow.

#### Running Program
After compiling the files, you can run the program with
`java Runner`
